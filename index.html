			<h1>Autism Possible</h1>
			<time>May 2012 - Present</time>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>I empower autistic individuals and their caretakers by giving them access to educational tools to become their own advocate. I bridge the gap between research and practice in technological integration. I believe that combining real life examples and research helps to bring all stakeholders together, which ultimately increases collaborative efforts.</p>

			<h3>Content Includes:</h3>
			<p>The Knowledge Base allows you to search through a database of questions you may have about special needs topics. </p>

			<p>App Finder and Device Finder are resources that will help you figure out what apps and devices may help your family meet goals.</p>

			<p>The Autism Possible Podcast answers TONS of the questions you might have. I created these podcasts after coming up empty in my own search for high-quality programming that would give me something I could do immediately to help my kiddo.</p>

			<h1>Meharry Medical College</h1>
			<time>October 2007 - October 2016</time>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>Significantly reduced cost and time by creating an in-house educational system (Learn@MMC) to provide educational and technical training to employees. The system substantially increased perceived value (based on assessment feedback) and also tracked and used data collected to identify possible opportunities to prepare and equip end-users in the field. </p>

			<p>Oversaw the creation and implementation of a virtual tour that helped Meharry Medical College secure a 26 million dollar grant and bridged relationships with another local medical institution.</p>

			<p>Significantly reduced the amount of calls to the Help Desk through creation of web based tutorials and training on information technologies such as end-user program, which include the MS Office suite, SCT Banner, the Adobe Creative Suite, and Google Applications. (Based on information collected through Help Desk Monitoring Software)</p>
