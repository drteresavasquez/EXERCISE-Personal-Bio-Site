# Personal-Bio-Site

Requirements

Create a two page site for your own personal branding. This is an HTML exercise, so while you may style this site to your heart's content, we will be focusing on the HTML structure and syntax of your code.

Pages

Professional history page

Basically an HTML version of your resume.
<ul>
	<li>Each place you've worked must be contained in an article element.</li>
	<li>Each article element should have a header that contains the name of the company and the dates of your employment. Ensure that the dates are semantically marked by being contained within the appropriate HTML element.</li>
	<li>Each article should contain at least one section that describes your position there.</li>
	<li>No footer required for these articles.</li>
</ul>

Contact information page

<ul>
	<li>One article.</li>
	<li>A heading (e.g. "How to contact me").</li>
	<li>Four sections that contain a home address, a phone number, and two social media URLs.</li>
</ul>

Common page elements

Navigation

Create a navigation bar on each page that contains a link to both pages. You can use whatever elements you like for the navigation, but it must be contained in the appropriate HTML5 semantic element.

Page header

Each page should have an <h1> title contained in the appropriate HTML5 semantic tag.

Page footer

Each page should have the same footer information. Put whatever information you like in the footer.# Personal-Bio-Site
